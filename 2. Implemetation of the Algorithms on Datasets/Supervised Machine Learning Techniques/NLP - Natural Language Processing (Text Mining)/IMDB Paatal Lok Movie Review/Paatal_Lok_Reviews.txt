"After a long time i have seen such depth in a script. The casting is near to impeccable. Direction, screenplay, cinematography, lighting, casting... everything is like DCP Bhagwat says in the series \"well oiled machinery\".
Everything complements each other.
What struck me most is the seamless transition of storytelling between the Lutyens Elite, the lower middle class and the substrata of the society.
The gut wrenching episode where the plight of the abandoned children is especially hard to watch through and that is a credit to the Director.
The character of Tyagi is scary at first with his soul reaping glares. However, as the story progresses, i became more sympathetic and was involuntarily rooting for him. Actually by the end of it all i was rooting for all the accused.
Apart from the Anurag Kashyapesque narration of the grassroot India what was commendable was the treatment of the Corporate + Potilical nexus and behind the door deals.
Go watch but be ready to get shaken...really shaken.
Well done"

"Very cringing story line which holds the use throughout the episodes but adding political miscarriages turns this beautiful and dark serious into a propaganda material! Reference used like flower as a party symbol, Bhajpayee as name, portraying hindu terror while sympathizing ISIS al Qaida, lynching based on animal cruelty(while chanting jai shree ram) are the small peices which creates a misconception in user mind and could be a situation where storytellers were forced on to do this so they can satisfy leftist liberalism! In india religions politics is on trends so maybe they have chose this as a trend but the overall centre was hindu terror and how a party insights violence to gain sympathy (in reality whole world knows what ISIS do and what is the similarities between ISIS and liberandus and appeasement politics).I'll close my review by stating it was a good thriller tool but got destroyed completely by referencing a hindu terror module as a base to sell Indian customer's!"

The trailer seemed to relate to something very sublime and surreal, where they have borrowed some stuff from the Hindu mythology. In reality it's a cliched \"pseudo - liberal chor police story\". If you are a believer of the government shamming and spamming machinery, then you shall come to find so much significance with this. One liners like \"ISI\" and \"Go Back To Pakistan\" and their most favourite minority victim card is a common screenplay to come by in abundance in this series.
This series has just aimed at flawing the entire country's administrative machinery, not sparing even CBI..
What else we can expect if the co director is Prosit Roy!
I would not give much spoiler about the story because there is none to be honest.
You would simply waste your time watching a 45 mins long episodes each comprising of 9 episodes.
The only saviour in this series is the acting of our protagonist Jaideep Ahlawaat."

If you are a believer of the government shamming and spamming machinery, then you shall come to find so much significance with this. One liners like \"ISI\" and \"Go Back To Pakistan\" and their most favourite minority victim card is a common screenplay to come by in abundance in this series.
This series has just aimed at flawing the entire country's administrative machinery, not sparing even CBI..
What else we can expect if the co director is Prosit Roy!
I would not give much spoiler about the story because there is none to be honest.
You would simply waste your time watching a 45 mins long episodes each comprising of 9 episodes.
The only saviour in this series is the acting of our protagonist Jaideep Ahlawaat."

And few people who are trying to make it left and right,or thinking it shows Hindus in bad light should really stop watching bollywood movies or series, because you can get offended by anything. I am a proud Hindu and didn't got hurt by anything i show or heard in this series. There is this 'katuwa' word if you notice and it also offends a perticular community.

"After a long time i have seen such depth in a script. The casting is near to impeccable. Direction, screenplay, cinematography, lighting, casting... everything is like DCP Bhagwat says in the series \"well oiled machinery\".
Everything complements each other.
What struck me most is the seamless transition of storytelling between the Lutyens Elite, the lower middle class and the substrata of the society.
The gut wrenching episode where the plight of the abandoned children is especially hard to watch through and that is a credit to the Director.
The character of Tyagi is scary at first with his soul reaping glares. However, as the story progresses, i became more sympathetic and was involuntarily rooting for him. Actually by the end of it all i was rooting for all the accused.
Apart from the Anurag Kashyapesque narration of the grassroot India what was commendable was the treatment of the Corporate + Potilical nexus and behind the door deals.
Go watch but be ready to get shaken...really shaken.
Well done"

"Very cringing story line which holds the use throughout the episodes but adding political miscarriages turns this beautiful and dark serious into a propaganda material! Reference used like flower as a party symbol, Bhajpayee as name, portraying hindu terror while sympathizing ISIS al Qaida, lynching based on animal cruelty(while chanting jai shree ram) are the small peices which creates a misconception in user mind and could be a situation where storytellers were forced on to do this so they can satisfy leftist liberalism! In india religions politics is on trends so maybe they have chose this as a trend but the overall centre was hindu terror and how a party insights violence to gain sympathy (in reality whole world knows what ISIS do and what is the similarities between ISIS and liberandus and appeasement politics).I'll close my review by stating it was a good thriller tool but got destroyed completely by referencing a hindu terror module as a base to sell Indian customer's!"

"This series have its own place,it is original and doesn't try to be anything else.,binged watched all episodes with 2 short breaks,if that helps. Very tight script that keeps you glued to your seat and makes you want more,and to accompany the script, there is this good acting. And few people who are trying to make it left and right,or thinking it shows Hindus in bad light should really stop watching bollywood movies or series, because you can get offended by anything. I am a proud Hindu and didn't got hurt by anything i show or heard in this series. There is this 'katuwa' word if you notice and it also offends a perticular community. So i totally disagree that it was biased to any religion or community.And most importantly its just a story so why not just watch it like that."

"After a long time i have seen such depth in a script. The casting is near to impeccable. Direction, screenplay, cinematography, lighting, casting... everything is like DCP Bhagwat says in the series \"well oiled machinery\".
Everything complements each other.
What struck me most is the seamless transition of storytelling between the Lutyens Elite, the lower middle class and the substrata of the society.
The gut wrenching episode where the plight of the abandoned children is especially hard to watch through and that is a credit to the Director.
The character of Tyagi is scary at first with his soul reaping glares. However, as the story progresses, i became more sympathetic and was involuntarily rooting for him. Actually by the end of it all i was rooting for all the accused.
Apart from the Anurag Kashyapesque narration of the grassroot India what was commendable was the treatment of the Corporate + Potilical nexus and behind the door deals.
Go watch but be ready to get shaken...really shaken.
Well done"

"Very cringing story line which holds the use throughout the episodes but adding political miscarriages turns this beautiful and dark serious into a propaganda material! Reference used like flower as a party symbol, Bhajpayee as name, portraying hindu terror while sympathizing ISIS al Qaida, lynching based on animal cruelty(while chanting jai shree ram) are the small peices which creates a misconception in user mind and could be a situation where storytellers were forced on to do this so they can satisfy leftist liberalism! In india religions politics is on trends so maybe they have chose this as a trend but the overall centre was hindu terror and how a party insights violence to gain sympathy (in reality whole world knows what ISIS do and what is the similarities between ISIS and liberandus and appeasement politics).I'll close my review by stating it was a good thriller tool but got destroyed completely by referencing a hindu terror module as a base to sell Indian customer's!"

The trailer seemed to relate to something very sublime and surreal, where they have borrowed some stuff from the Hindu mythology. In reality it's a cliched \"pseudo - liberal chor police story\". If you are a believer of the government shamming and spamming machinery, then you shall come to find so much significance with this. One liners like \"ISI\" and \"Go Back To Pakistan\" and their most favourite minority victim card is a common screenplay to come by in abundance in this series.
This series has just aimed at flawing the entire country's administrative machinery, not sparing even CBI..
What else we can expect if the co director is Prosit Roy!
I would not give much spoiler about the story because there is none to be honest.
You would simply waste your time watching a 45 mins long episodes each comprising of 9 episodes.
The only saviour in this series is the acting of our protagonist Jaideep Ahlawaat."
