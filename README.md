# DataScience_R_Codes
This Repository Contains R-Codes executed on various Datasets in RStudio. I Hope This Repository is very helpful for those who are Willing to build their Career in Data Science, Big Data. I am a Beginner in this Field so kindly Forgive if there are Small Mistakes. Suggestions through Mail for Improving the Analysis are always Welcome.

You will Need Rstudio to Execute all the Codes So Install it first and then Go through the Below Codes.
To Download Rstudio, [Click Here](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

To Begin with the **Basics** of the **_Data Science_**, go through the **Practice(Basics)** Folder in the Repository.
