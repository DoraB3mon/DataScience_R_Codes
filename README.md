# DataScience_R_Codes
This Repository Contains R-Codes executed on various Datasets in RStudio. I Hope This Repository is very helpful for those who are Willing to build their Career in Data Science, Big Data. I am a Beginner in this Field so kindly Forgive if there are Small Mistakes. Suggestions through Mail for Improving the Analysis are always Welcome.

You will Need Rstudio to Execute all the Codes So Install it first and then Go through the Below Codes.
To Download Rstudio, [Click Here](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

To Begin with the **Basics** of the **_Data Science_**, go through the **Practice(Basics)** Folder in the Repository.

### Web Scraping

If you want to extract the Reviews of a particular Product from Amazon then Run the Below Code in Rstudio.

**This Code is Valid only for the Products on Amazon**.

*The Code Varies from site to site*.

```rstudio
install.packages("rvest")
install.packages("XML")
install.packages("magrittr")

library(rvest)
library(XML)
library(magrittr)

# Amazon Reviews #############################
aurl <- "URL of Product Reviews page"
amazon_reviews <- NULL
for (i in 1:10){
  murl <- read_html(as.character(paste(aurl,i,sep="=")))
  rev <- murl %>%
    html_nodes(".review-text") %>%
    html_text()
  amazon_reviews <- c(amazon_reviews,rev)
}
length(amazon_reviews)
write.table(amazon_reviews,"apple.txt",row.names = F)
```
I have Performed this code for Extracting [Reviews of Apple Macbook Air](https://github.com/pravinknr/DataScience_R_Codes/blob/master/1.%20Practice(Basics)/web_Scraping_AmazonOnly.r), Do check it Out.
